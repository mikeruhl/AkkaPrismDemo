# AkkaPrismDemo

This project is a loose fork from [mkb137/AkkaPrismUnityDemo](https://github.com/mkb137/AkkaPrismUnityDemo).  It is a stock ticker demo showing Prism, Unity, and Akka.NET.  I take no responsibility for the code quality.  I merely copy/pasted the code into this solution to get it to build and run.

## Getting Started

To build, restore nuget dependencies, build the 3 included projects, and run AkkaPrismDemo.


## Running the tests

There are no tests!  Please note this was a lift and shift from the aforementioned project.  I just wanted to get it working so I could see it.

## Built With

* [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) - MVVM Framework used
* [Unity](https://github.com/unitycontainer) - Container Framework
* [Akka.NET](https://http://getakka.net/) - Actor Model Microservice Framework

## Contributing

This project is closed for outside contribution.  It is a forked project.

* Hat tip to Mike Bennett.  In no way am I taking credit for this code.  I merely dumped it into a new project.  Perhaps in the future I will build from it but most likely I will not.
